# Todo

## Not Started

- [ ] Modify footer template structure of the appropriate content types/categories to include Dataview queries

- [ ] Clarify the difference between Resources table and footnotes (maybe an informal style guide?)

- [ ] Add Python script to scrape MITRE ATT&CK Framework and generate TTP notes

- [ ] Improve "Biography" content type's timeline template

- [ ] Templater Plugin Script Enhancements
  - [ ] Modify/add new Templater script to permit creating a new Content Type directly (currently only supports content type creation by going through note creation workflow)
  - [ ] Go back button during note creation workflow (possibly not supportable)
  - [ ] Sanitize search tag emoji because titles can contain illegal tag characters (e.g., "$" is a valid character for note titles, but not tags)
  - [ ] Need a hack for preventing file getting created via Templater if the user cancels the workflow or an unexpected error occurs
  - [ ] Modify back-linking primary/secondary categories menu
    - [ ] Proceed without selecting a category
    - [ ] De-select a category
